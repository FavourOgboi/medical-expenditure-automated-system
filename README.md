# Medical Expenditure Automated System

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and a CSV file that covers using linear regression to predict medical expenditure. The notebook includes information on data loading and preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and prediction. The CSV file contains the data used to train and test the linear regression model.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create an automated system that can predict medical expenditure based on various factors such as age, sex, bmi, and number of children. By using linear regression, we can predict the cost of treatment for a new patient with a certain set of characteristics, which can help medical facilities plan and budget accordingly.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the repository.
3. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Open the Jupyter notebook `medical-charges-prediction.ipynb` and run the code.
5. Explore the data and the results of the linear regression model.

## Note
- The data used in this project is simulated and should not be used for medical diagnosis or treatment.
- The linear regression model is a simple model and it's not meant to be used in a production environment.
